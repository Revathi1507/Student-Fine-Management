🎓 Student Fine Management System

The Student Fine Management System is a console-based Java application designed to manage and track student fine payments efficiently.

This system implements role-based access control, allowing different users (Admin, Cashier, and Student) to perform specific operations based on their permissions.

The project is developed using Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with data stored in memory using ArrayList collections instead of a database.
